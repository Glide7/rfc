# Swag store <!-- What do you want to call your `awesome_feature`? -->

- Implementation Owner: @Glide7

- Target Date: Unknown
- Appwrite Issue: None
  

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

Developer (and everyone) love swag. Appwrite is a kick-ass company, so we should have swag! In order for us to be able to continue to work on Appwrite, and still have the ability to provide swag, we should use a service ( such as Printful, Shopify) that makes swag on demand. Swag refers to anything Appwrite branded, such as shirts, hoodies, stickers, mugs and etc'. 

## Problem Statement (Step 1)

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

**What problem are you trying to solve?**

At the current time, we do not have any scalable or easy way to produce swag both for us or the community. from my (little) expeirnce, dealing with ordering, sizes, printing, getting addresses and shipping - I've seen that it is complicated and cumbersome to do.

**What is the context or background in which this problem exists?**

Right now, when we have a hackathon or we want to be able to send swag to community members, it puts a toll on our time and efforts to send swag or even sell swag.

**Once the proposal is implemented, how will the system change?**

Once the proposal is implemented, community members and Appwrite will be able to buy swag off a dedicated service, on demand, per specific request (color, size, type)

<!-- Please avoid discussing your proposed solution. -->

## Design proposal (Step 2)

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

<!--
This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail keeping in mind the following:

- Its interaction with other parts of the system is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the contribution would be implemented
- Dependencies on libraries, tools, projects or work that isn't yet complete
- New API routes that need to be created or modifications to the existing routes (if needed)
- Any breaking changes and ways in which we can ensure backward compatibility.
- Use Cases
- Goals
- Deliverables
- Changes to documentation
- Ways to scale the solution

Ensure that you include examples, code-snippets etc. to allow the community to understand the proposed solution. **It would be best if the examples use naming conventions that you intend to use during the actual implementation so that changes can be suggested early on during the development.**

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

<!--

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this functionality exist in other software and what experience has their
  community had?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have
  done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If
  you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
  theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other software, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us
whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other software.
